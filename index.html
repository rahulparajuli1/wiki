           By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the
            Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier
            evolved.[31][32][33] The earliest known modern human remains in
            South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[34] The oldest discovered
            archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to
            around the same time.[35] After 6500 BC, evidence for the
            domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
            structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh
            and other sites in what is now Balochistan.[36] These gradually
            developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[37][36] the first
            urban culture in South Asia.[38] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic,
            mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik
            hills of Dang district.[39] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal
            and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley
            Civilisation. It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history
            predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent
            (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other
            ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across
            the border.[40] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached
            Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar
            and north-east India or both.[41] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a
            substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in
            Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient
            inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.[42]
